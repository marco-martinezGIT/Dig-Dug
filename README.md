# Dig Dug: A remake
> By Marco Martinez and Swajal Padhi

Introduction
This project was chosed by us to showcase what all we had learned in the Embedded Systems course. On a PCB we designed and assembled, out aim was to replicate the Dig Dug experience on a more portable device. This would require us to also accommodate for the low memory of our board, and to create efficient code.

### Implemented Using:
- [C](https://devdocs.io/c/)
- [MSPM0 Microcontroller](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/1_00_00_04/docs/english/MSPM0_SDK_Documentation_Overview.html)
